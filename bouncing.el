  "Toggle bouncing mode.

   When bouncing mode is enabled, any time a multi-keystroke
   command is entered, repeating the last keystroke will repeat
   the command. Thus the behavior of {kmacro-end-and-call-macro}
   is replicated for any command that is bound to a multiple key
   sequence.

   Interactively with no argument, this command toggles the mode.
   A positive prefix argument enables the mode, any other prefix
   argument disables it.  From Lisp, argument omitted or nil
   enables the mode, `toggle' toggles the state.
